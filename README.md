# snakeduino
Just for fun. Using Arduino Nano and Nokia 5110 LCD.

## Description
Project contains code of game, stl files for 3d printing and connection scheme. Graphic library uses most of memory, and if you want, you free to rewrite code as you want. 
For using Adafruit graphic libraries for 5110 display, you need to include it before:
```
#include <Adafruit_GFX.h>
#include <Adafruit_PCD8544.h>
```
